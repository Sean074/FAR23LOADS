## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Packaging & tooling** — `pyproject.toml` (editable install via
  `pip install -e '.[dev]'`; `ruff` and `pytest`/coverage config), `cspell.json`
  domain wordlist, and a GitHub Actions CI workflow running `ruff` + `pytest` on
  Python 3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12.
- **Documentation structure** — `docs/` reorganised by type
  (`10_standard` / `20_theory` / `30_future` / `40_history`) with an index
  (`docs/00_INDEX.md`). Added `docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md`,
  `docs/30_future/00_backlog.md`, and `docs/40_history/00_completed_development.md`.
- **Process guides** — `docs/10_standard/CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` and
  `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`, specialised for the module-porting workflow.
- **`LICENSE`** (MIT) backing the `pyproject.toml` license declaration, plus
  README License and Disclaimer sections (results are not certified for design).
- **`docs/10_standard/00_program_overview.md`** — consolidated program code
  standard & developer guide (coding standards, an error-handling contract,
  units, entry points, testing/coverage), with `docs/00_INDEX.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
  pointing to it as the authoritative standard.
- **CI coverage floor** — the pytest step now runs with `--cov-fail-under=80` so
  coverage cannot silently regress (a ratchet, to be raised toward 85%).

### Changed

- `farloads` and `cli` are now an editable install, so they import from any cwd;
  removed the `sys.path` shims from `app/Home.py` and `app/pages/19_Engine_Mount.py`.
- Renamed the ambiguous local helper `l` to `ln` in `farloads/units.py` (lint).
- Fixed stale `calc.py` references (the module is `farloads/modules/engine.py`) in
  `farloads/models.py` and `farloads/report.py` comments/docstrings.
- `CLAUDE.md` mandate strengthened: consult the `reference/` PDFs when generating
  analysis code, keep `docs/` in sync with every code change, and follow the
  backlog → history → changelog move-on-completion rule.
- `docs/PROGRAM_SPEC.md` and `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md` moved to `docs/10_standard/`;
  cross-references in `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated.

## [0.1.0]

Phase 0 baseline — the package restructure with the engine-mount module ported.
See `docs/40_history/00_completed_development.md` for the full record.

### Added

- `farloads/` pure-calc package (`models`, `modules/engine`, `registry`, `io`,
  `units`, `report`, `constants`), the `app/` Streamlit multi-page UI, and
  `cli.py`. Engine-mount module (`ENGLOADS`) validated against Appendix A/B.
