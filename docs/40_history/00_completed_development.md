# Completed Development

The authoritative record of what has shipped: completed modules/phases, key
decisions, and resolved defects. Items move here from
[`../30_future/00_backlog.md`](../30_future/00_backlog.md) the moment they close,
with a matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

Each entry uses the step format: **Objective**, **Deliverables**, **Test /
Acceptance**, **Key decisions**.

## GUI — workflow-phased restructure (complete)

**Objective.** Reorganise the Streamlit UI to mirror the engineering workflow —
**Define → Analyze → Review → Export** — replacing the flat, filename-numbered page
list (which had drifted: a Phase-0 Home page, a duplicate `06_` index, no review or
export surface) with a navigation driven by a single source of truth.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/workflow.py` — the ordered, dependency-aware step graph. Each
  `WorkflowStep` names its calc `module` and the slices it `requires`/`produces`,
  grouped into the four phases. Pure metadata + predicates over a `Project` (no
  Streamlit), the seed of a future dependency DAG.
- `app/Home.py` rewritten as the `st.navigation` entry point: a four-phase sidebar
  built from `workflow.py`, so page order/titles come from workflow metadata, not
  filename prefixes. `set_page_config` is called once, here only.
- `app/pages/NN_*.py` → `app/views/<workflow-key>.py` (20 pages, clean names, no
  numeric prefixes — the duplicate-`06` collision is gone); each view's own
  `set_page_config` removed.
- New `app/views/dashboard.py` (Overview: load/save project + per-step completeness
  panel), `results_review.py` (Review: consolidated governing loads, recomputed live
  from inputs), `export_report.py` (Export: project JSON, per-module load CSVs +
  combined text report, sbeam wing/fuselage/tail/control-surface BDF cards, and a
  single **Download all `.zip`** bundle).
- Fixed a pre-existing crash in the engine-mount page (still used the removed
  single-engine `Project(engine=...)` API → `engines=[...]` + `SINGLE_NOSE`).

**Test / Acceptance.** `tests/test_workflow.py` (graph well-formedness; every
registered module has a step) and `tests/test_views_smoke.py` (headless `AppTest`
runs the entry point + all 20 views with the example project, asserting no uncaught
exception — the guard that would have caught the engine-mount regression). Full
suite green (242 tests).

**Key decisions.**
1. **`st.navigation`, not the implicit `pages/` directory** — explicit page list
   decouples nav order/titles from filenames and removes numeric-prefix coupling.
2. **One workflow source of truth** (`workflow.py`) drives both the nav and the
   dashboard completeness, so the GUI can never silently omit a shipped module.
3. **Consolidation pages recompute from inputs**, never from persisted result slices
   (which were only half-wired and could go stale) — Review/Export are always current.
4. **JSON stays the spine, CSV stays at the edges** — `project.json` remains the
   single typed source of truth; CSV/BDF are export-only hand-offs (CSV *import* for
   bulk tabular inputs deferred — see backlog).

---

## Phase 0 — Package restructure (complete)

**Objective.** Recast the standalone `engloads` program into the shared
pure-calc package + thin-shell architecture that every subsequent module will
follow, with the engine-mount module as the proof of pattern.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/` pure-calc package: `models.py` (`Project`, `EngineInput`/`Rotor`,
  `ConditionResult`/`LoadValue`, `ModuleResult`, `SCHEMA_VERSION`),
  `modules/engine.py` (port of `ENGLOADS.BAS`), `registry.py`, `io.py`,
  `units.py`, `report.py`, `constants.py`.
- `app/` Streamlit multi-page UI (`Home.py` + `pages/19_Engine_Mount.py`).
- `cli.py` argparse front-end.
- `tests/` suite vs the manual's Appendix A/B figures.

**Test / Acceptance.** Green build — full `pytest` suite passing, engine module
checked against Appendix A (p131) and Appendix B (p251) figures within ±0.1%.

**Key decisions.**
1. **Hybrid architecture** — one shared calc package, interchangeable GUI/CLI/test
   front-ends; calc does no I/O.
2. **Single reloadable `Project`** — one JSON bundle carries every module's input
   slice; `schema_version` from day one.
3. **Modernize the math** — `math.pi` and clean equations, *not* the BASIC's
   `3.1416`. The manual's printed figures become **tolerance-based** regression
   oracles (±0.1%), not exact oracles. Constants centralised in `constants.py` so
   this stays a one-file decision.
4. **Preserved engineering conventions** — engine-mount reaction torque reported
   negative; "clockwise from the pilot's view is positive"; selected intermediate
   quantities truncated to 3 decimals (`int(x*1000)/1000`) to mirror the BASIC.

---

## Phase 1 — Mass properties: WTESTIMA + WTONECG (complete)

**Objective.** Port the head of the mass-properties pipeline: weight estimation
(`WTESTIMA`) and one-loading weight/CG/inertia (`WTONECG`), establishing the
shared `Project.weight` slice the downstream load modules will read. `WTENV` was
**re-scoped to Phase 2** (its structural-CG-limit math needs `XLEMAC`/`MAC` from
`WINGGEOM`); see the backlog.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/models.py` — `Project.weight` slice (`WeightInput`) carrying mission
  `estimation` inputs (`WeightEstimationInput`) and the itemized `items` mass list
  (`MassItem`), plus `EngineWeightType` and `MassItemKind` enums.
- `farloads/modules/weight_estimate.py` (`WTESTIMA.BAS`) and
  `farloads/modules/weight_onecg.py` (`WTONECG.BAS`), self-registered as
  `weight_estimate` / `weight_onecg`. Mass-properties constants and the
  installed-engine-weight correlation centralised in `constants.py`.
- `farloads/io.py` — `weight_from_dict`/`weight_to_dict` wired into the project
  JSON round-trip; `load_cases_csv` falls back to the generic property table for
  modules that emit no structural load cases.
- `report.module_text_report` and a generalised `cli.py` text path so non-engine
  modules render to stdout.
- `app/pages/01_Weight_Estimate.py`, `app/pages/02_Weight_CG_Inertia.py` (Imperial
  units; the CG page edits the weight data base in a `st.data_editor`).
- `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` extended with the Appendix A weight slice;
  `tests/test_weight_estimate.py` and `tests/test_weight_onecg.py`.

**Test / Acceptance.** Green build — `ruff check farloads/ cli.py` clean, full
`pytest` suite passing with the coverage floor held (≥80%). `WTESTIMA` reproduces
Appendix A p133 exactly (integer-truncated figures); `WTONECG` matches Appendix A
p136 within ±0.1% (weight and lb-in² accumulators are g-independent and exact).

**Key decisions.**
1. **One input slice, pure-calc outputs.** `Project.weight` is the shared input
   "weight database"; modules stay pure (`run → ModuleResult`). No persisted
   `Project.mass` slice yet — it is added when a consumer (FLTLOADS/LANDLOAD)
   exists.
2. **Property table, not load cases.** Mass-properties results render via
   `results_to_rows`/`module_text_report`, not the engine-specific
   `load_cases_to_rows`.
3. **Force vs mass units.** A weight is pounds-*mass* and must convert to kg, but
   a load in `lb` is pounds-*force* and converts to N — the same `"lb"` label.
   `LoadValue` gained an optional `quantity` hint; a weight sets `quantity="mass"`
   so `units.py` routes it to kg, while loads (blank hint) convert by unit string
   to N. Inertia (slug-ft²/lb-in²) → kg·m². The mass-properties pages expose an SI
   output toggle on this basis; inputs stay Imperial.
4. **Preserved BASIC quirks** — `INT(...)` truncation on `WTESTIMA` outputs, and
   the single-engine "misc other system wt = 0" (the program prints an unset
   variable there).

---

## Phase 2 — Geometry: WINGGEOM + first-class multi-engine (complete)

**Objective.** Port aerodynamic-surface geometry (`WINGGEOM`) — the wing's
`MAC`/`XLEMAC` seed `WTENV` and `STRSPEED` — and, alongside it, promote the engine
slice to first-class multi-engine support (resolving PROJECT_GUIDE open decision
#2) so geometry/weight/speeds can reference the engine layout now and `ONENGOUT`
can exercise it fully later.

**Deliverables.**
- **Multi-engine schema** — `EngineLayout` enum (`SINGLE_NOSE`/`TWIN_WING`/
  `QUAD_WING`, symmetric); `Project.engines: List[EngineInput]` + `engine_layout`
  with `__post_init__` count validation and a read-only `Project.engine` compat
  property. `io.py` reads the new `engines`/`engine_layout` JSON or the legacy
  single `engine` key; `modules/engine.py` `run()` loops over every engine
  (single-engine output byte-identical, multi-engine prefixed by designation).
- `farloads/models.py` — `Project.geometry` slice (`GeometryInput` →
  `SurfaceInput` per surface: LE/TE point polylines, `symmetric`, `elements`).
- `farloads/modules/wing_geometry.py` (`WINGGEOM.BAS`), self-registered as
  `wing_geometry`: strip-sum area/MAC/YBAR/XLEMAC/AR/span per surface, plus
  wing-mounted engine spanwise stations driven by `engine_layout`.
- `farloads/io.py` — `geometry_from_dict`/`geometry_to_dict`; `units.py` gained
  area (`in²`→m²) and airspeed (`knot`→m/s) SI output conversions.
- `app/pages/03_Wing_Geometry.py` (per-surface point editors, SI output toggle);
  `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` extended with wing + aileron surfaces and the
  multi-engine layout form; `tests/test_wing_geometry.py` and new multi-engine
  assertions in `tests/test_engine.py`.

**Test / Acceptance.** Green build — `ruff check farloads/ cli.py` clean, full
`pytest` suite passing, coverage floor held (≥80%). The **wing** reproduces
Appendix A p141 within ±0.1% (AREA/SIDE 13257, MAC 69.246, YLE(MAC) 87.854,
XLE(MAC) 63.641, AR 6.095) at the manual's 20-element strip count; the aileron
exercises the unsymmetric path (checked loosely, since Appendix A does not
tabulate its element count).

**Key decisions.**
1. **Strip count is an input, oracle is H-specific.** The manual's printed figures
   *are* the `H`-element midpoint strip sum, so `elements` must match the manual's
   value (20 for the wing) to reproduce them — kept as a per-surface field.
2. **Multi-engine first-class now.** Engine list + layout modelled this phase;
   the engine module loops over engines, but one-engine-out *loads* remain at
   `ONENGOUT`. Backward-compatible: legacy single-`engine` JSON still loads.
3. **Wing is the authoritative oracle.** `XLEMAC`/`MAC` (the figures the whole
   pipeline cites) are matched tightly; secondary surfaces use the same calc.

---

## Phase 1 (deferred item) — WTENV weight/CG envelope (complete)

**Objective.** Complete the mass-properties phase by porting `WTENV` — the
discretionary-loading envelope, structural CG limits and ballast — which was
re-scoped to land after `WINGGEOM` because its limit stations need the wing
`XLEMAC`/`MAC`.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/models.py` — `WeightEnvelopeInput` under `Project.weight.envelope`
  (gross weight, the three %-MAC CG limits, the forward-regardless reduced weight,
  and an optional XLEMAC/MAC override).
- `farloads/modules/weight_envelope.py` (`WTENV.BAS`), self-registered as
  `weight_envelope`: empty / minimum-flight / maximum loadings; structural-limit
  stations `X = XLEMAC + pct·MAC` (reading the wing geometry through WINGGEOM's
  `surface_properties`, not re-deriving it); the forward loading envelope; and the
  ballast per limit by moment balance.
- `farloads/io.py` — envelope (de)serialization on the weight slice;
  `app/pages/04_Weight_Envelope.py`; envelope inputs in the example;
  `tests/test_weight_envelope.py`.

**Test / Acceptance.** Green build — `ruff check farloads/ cli.py` clean, full
`pytest` suite passing, coverage floor held (≥80%). Reproduces Chapter 3 p21-22:
stations 85.1 / 77.49 / 72.64, minimum flight weight 2063 @ 73.09, maximum loading
3322 @ 84.56, and ballast weights 78 / 418 / 158 lb (forward-gross/forward-
regardless ballast *stations* also match: 80.27 / 70.97).

**Key decisions.**
1. **Read geometry, don't re-derive.** WTENV obtains XLEMAC/MAC by calling
   WINGGEOM's pure `surface_properties` on the wing surface — honouring "read
   shared, write own".
2. **Ballast is the exact moment balance.** Per Decision 3 the aft-gross ballast
   station is reported as the precise balance (~108.5 in); the original manual's
   hand calc rounded the limit station to 85.0 (giving the 103.7 its own WTONECG
   data base then carried). The ballast *weights* match exactly.
3. **Documented reference-point selection.** The ballast reference loadings are
   chosen as in the worked example (full load for aft gross; the forward-boundary
   knee for forward gross; the heaviest forward point ≤ reduced weight for forward
   regardless), reproducing all three manual ballast weights.

---

## Phase 2 — Structural design speeds: STRSPEED (complete)

**Objective.** Port the design-airspeed and limit-maneuver-load-factor module
(`STRSPEED`), which seeds the flight-envelope and control-surface load modules
(FLTLOADS, AILERON, FLAPLOAD) and shares its standard-atmosphere/Mach machinery
with `MACHLIM`.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/models.py` — `StructuralSpeedsInput` and the `Project.speeds` slice
  (category, design weight, stall speeds, VH, shoulder altitude, chosen speeds and
  load factors).
- `farloads/modules/structural_speeds.py` (`STRSPEED.BAS`), self-registered as
  `structural_speeds`: FAR 23.337 maneuver load factors, FAR 23.335 design speeds
  (VA/VC/VD/VF) with their minimums, and cruise/dive Mach at the shoulder altitude.
- `farloads/constants.py` — shared `standard_atmosphere(altitude)` (a, sigma, with
  the tropopause branch) plus `cruise_speed_coefficient`/`dive_ratio_coefficient`,
  reused by MACHLIM next.
- `farloads/io.py` — speeds (de)serialization; `app/pages/05_Structural_Speeds.py`;
  speeds slice in the example; `tests/test_structural_speeds.py`.

**Test / Acceptance.** Green build — `ruff check farloads/ cli.py` clean, full
`pytest` suite passing, coverage floor held (≥80%). Reproduces the Appendix A V-n
table within ±0.1%: VA 121.3, VC 170, VD 212.5, VF 105.5 kt (EAS); n = +3.8 /
−1.52; MC 0.323 / MD 0.403 at the 12000 ft shoulder altitude; VC(min) 141.8 kt;
wing area 184.1 ft².

**Key decisions.**
1. **Wing area from geometry.** S is read from the WINGGEOM wing surface
   (total area in² → ft²), not re-entered — "read shared, write own".
2. **VD floor is 1.25·VC.** The worked example's governing dive-speed bound is the
   absolute FAR 23.335(b) floor 1.25·VC (212.5 kt); the gust-based K_d·VC (238 kt)
   is reported as the recommended value but not enforced, matching the manual.
3. **Shared atmosphere helper.** `standard_atmosphere` lives once in
   `constants.py` so STRSPEED and MACHLIM cannot drift; the shoulder altitude
   (12000 ft for the example) is an input.

---

## Phase 2 — Mach-limit lines: MACHLIM (complete)

**Objective.** Port the Mach-limit-line module (`MACHLIM`) — the V-vs-altitude
limit lines for the flight-limits diagram — completing Phase 2.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/models.py` — `MachLimitInput` on `Project.speeds.mach_limit` (MC, MD,
  shoulder/max altitudes, increment).
- `farloads/modules/mach_limit.py` (`MACHLIM.BAS`), self-registered as
  `mach_limit`: `MNE = 0.9·MD`, `MFC = 1.2·MD`, and the per-altitude
  Mach-limited equivalent airspeeds `V(M) = M·a·√σ` (reusing
  `constants.standard_atmosphere`, including its tropopause branch).
- `farloads/io.py` — nested `mach_limit` (de)serialization on the speeds slice;
  `app/pages/06_Mach_Limit.py` (with a V-vs-altitude line chart);
  mach_limit inputs in the example; `tests/test_mach_limit.py`.

**Test / Acceptance.** Green build — `ruff check farloads/ cli.py` clean, full
`pytest` suite passing, coverage floor held (≥80%). Reproduces Appendix A p160
within ±0.1%: MNE 0.3627, MFC 0.4836, and the EAS table from V(MC) 170.16 /
V(MD) 212.31 at 12000 ft down to V(MC) 150.77 / V(MD) 188.11 at 18000 ft.

**Key decisions.**
1. **Reuses the shared atmosphere.** No second copy of the atmosphere law; the
   program's `a = 29.02` vs the helper's `29.02436` is a ~0.01% difference
   absorbed by the ±0.1% tolerance (Decision 3).
2. **Per-altitude condition rows.** Each altitude is its own `ConditionResult`, so
   the CSV/text/GUI render the limit-line table directly and the GUI can chart it.

---

## Phase C — Step C0: concept-mode foundation & mission reframe (complete)

**Objective.** Remove the two GA-only assumptions that block >12,500 lb /
greater-than-GA-seat configurations — the FAR 23.337 maneuver-load-factor
formula/cap and WTESTIMA's statistical estimate — without disturbing the
oracle-locked FAR23 path. (Prerequisite for the Phase-C concept loads tool;
narrative in [`../30_future/01_concept_loads_plan.md`](../30_future/01_concept_loads_plan.md).)

**Deliverables.**
- `models.py` — `StructuralSpeedsInput.category` gains `"C"` (concept), documented
  as requiring explicit `chosen_n`/`chosen_nneg`; `WeightInput.direct_totals()`
  (the direct-weight path: MTOW/OEW/useful summed from the itemized `items` by
  `MassItemKind`); `Project.is_concept` (single concept read-point); `SCHEMA_VERSION`
  bumped 1 → 2 (additive — v1 files load unchanged via the `from_dict` defaults).
- `modules/structural_speeds.py` — `_maneuver_load_factors` branches on concept,
  using the user's load factors verbatim with no FAR floor/cap; the load-factor
  result note flags the unverified extrapolation. The GA-calibrated VC(min)/VD(min)
  coefficients remain as out-of-band advisories (concept supplies chosen speeds).
- `modules/weight_estimate.py` — `run()` flags the WTESTIMA summary as a GA
  sanity estimate in concept mode; `estimate()` is unchanged so the Appendix-A
  oracle still holds.
- UI — Structural Speeds page adds the Concept (C) category with `n`/`n_neg`
  inputs and an unverified-extrapolation warning; the Weight Estimate page shows a
  concept sanity banner.
- `examples/concept_heavy.project.json` — an 18,000 lb concept commuter twin.

**Test / Acceptance.** All pre-existing tests pass unchanged (FAR23 identity
invariant). New `tests/test_concept.py` (`direct_totals` by kind; end-to-end
fixture run; IO round-trip) and concept cases in `tests/test_structural_speeds.py`
(cap bypassed; missing load factors raise). The fixture (MTOW > 12,500, user n)
runs STRSPEED and WTESTIMA end-to-end with the chosen factors (4.0 / -2.0) honoured
verbatim. **Confirmed** no hard ≤12,500 lb / seat-count assertion was load-bearing
(STRSPEED only checks `w > 0`; WTESTIMA only `engines >= 1` / `seats >= 1`; WTENV
none).

**Key decisions.**
1. **Concept is a strict superset** — `category == "C"` switches off the GA caps;
   the physics is unchanged and reduces exactly to FAR23 on GA inputs.
2. **Direct-weight = sum the itemized data base by kind** — one source of truth (no
   parallel direct-MTOW field that could disagree with the items list).
3. **Docs scope reframe landed with the plan** — CLAUDE.md / README.md /
   PROJECT_GUIDE.md were reframed when the Phase-C plan was adopted; C0 is the code.

---

## Phase C — Step C1: AIRLOADS (Schrenk spanwise lift) + TAU (complete)

**Objective.** Compute the wing spanwise lift distribution (`c·cl` span load) —
the first real distributed-load deliverable and the input every downstream
wing-load module (FLTLOADS balancing, WINGINER, NETLOADS, the sbeam export)
consumes. Method: **Schrenk's** (Reference 1 Ch 7, p46-47; CAA-accepted per CAM 04
App V) — average the planform-chord and elliptic lift distributions. (Narrative in
[`../30_future/01_concept_loads_plan.md`](../30_future/01_concept_loads_plan.md) §C1.)

**Equations (Ref 1 Ch 7).** Per strip (mid-station `ye`, chord `c`, width `dy`),
reusing the WINGGEOM strip integrator so stations align with the geometry table:
- additive (CL=1): `c·cl = 0.5·( mo·c/Mo + 4S/(π·B)·√(1−(2ye/B)²) )`, with
  `Mo = Σ(mo·c·dy)/(S/2)`, `S = 2·Σ(c·dy)`, `B = 2·ytip`;
- basic (twist): `Awo = Σ(mo·c·ac·dy)/Σ(mo·c·dy)`, `aa = ac − Awo`,
  `c·cl_basic = (mo/2)·aa·c`;
- combine at target CL: `c·cl = c·cl_additive·CL + c·cl_basic` (basic integrates to
  zero net wing lift);
- TAU planform correction from the `TAU.BAS` quartic curve-fit in taper ratio,
  interpolated by tip ratio (p407); wing slope `M = mo_rad/(1 + mo_rad/(π·AR)·(1+τ))`.

**Deliverables.**
- `models.py` — `AeroSurfaceInput` (section slope `mo`, taper/tip ratio, optional
  `tau` override, spanwise `twist` table, `target_cl`) + `AeroInput`; `Project.aero`;
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 2 → 3 (additive — older files load unchanged).
- `modules/airloads.py` — registers `"airloads"`; `_tau` curve-fit helper;
  `schrenk_distribution()` returns the per-strip `SpanwiseTable` (additive/basic/
  total `c·cl` and `cl`, plus `Mo`/`M`/`τ`/`Awo`/area/span and the integrated-CL
  closure); `spanwise_distribution()` wraps it as a reportable `ConditionResult`;
  `run(project)` flags concept mode as an unverified extrapolation. Reuses
  `wing_geometry._interp_x` for chord and twist interpolation.
- `io.py` — `aero_from_dict`/`aero_to_dict` round-trip; wired into the project
  load/save. `modules/__init__.py` imports `airloads` for self-registration.
- UI — `app/pages/06_Airloads.py`: aero inputs + editable twist table, a span-load
  plot (additive / basic / total), and the recovered-CL closure metric.
- Fixtures — the GA (`ga6_normal`) and concept (`concept_heavy`) projects gain an
  `aero` wing slice (concept also gains a wing planform).

**Test / Acceptance.** New `tests/test_airloads.py` (10 tests). FAR23 oracle
(±0.1%, `math.isclose(rel_tol=1e-3)`) vs Appendix A p161-162: additive `CC(LA1)`
elem 1/10/20 = 91.05576 / 69.44847 / 31.82978, `C(LA1)` elem 1 = 0.9275981, additive
integral CL = 1.00061; basic `Awo` = 3.988146, `CC(lb)` elem 1 = +5.09762, `Clb`
elem 1 = 0.05193; area/span/AR match WINGGEOM (26513.4 / 402 / 6.095). TAU curve-fit
(square-tip `τ(λ=0)` = 0.206209; `τ = 0` at tip ratio 1). Concept closure: the
`concept_heavy` integral recovers `target_cl` and the basic distribution carries
zero net lift. IO round-trip + missing-slice `ValueError`. All pre-existing tests
pass unchanged (FAR23 identity) — 93 passing.

**Key decisions.**
1. **Full Schrenk (additive + basic + combine)** — needed to reproduce the Appendix A
   wing, which has washout (root 5° → tip 1.9°).
2. **Aero slice carries inputs; the distribution flows out as a `ModuleResult`** —
   no persisted result-in-project field until a consumer (C2) needs one (avoids
   speculative state); matches the existing module pattern.
3. **Basic-distribution fairing deferred** — the cosine fairing across a flap/aileron
   lift discontinuity (Ref 1 p47) only arises with deflected flaps and is absent from
   the Appendix A wing; left as a documented limitation for a later step.

---

## Phase C — Step C2: FLTLOADS (V-n envelope + balancing tail loads) (complete)

**Objective.** Port the FAR 23.333 maneuver + gust flight envelope and the
balancing horizontal-tail load at every corner — the candidate-condition matrix
SELECT later prunes and WINGINER/NETLOADS consume.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/models.py` — new **`Project.flight_loads`** input slice
  (`FlightLoadsInput`: `mac`/`wing_area_sqft`/`xw`/`zw`/`xtc`/`xtf`, reference Mach
  `mn`, altitude list, per-configuration `AeroCoeffSet` aero-coefficient polynomials
  CL(α)/CD(CL)/CM(α) + stall CLs, weight-CG `CgCase` list) and the new
  **`Project.envelope`** result slice (`EnvelopeResult.vn` / `.tail_balance`:
  `VnPoint` + `TailBalanceLoad`). `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped to **4** (additive — older
  files load unchanged); `io.py` round-trip extended for both slices.
- `farloads/modules/flight_envelope.py` — faithful port of FLTLOADS.BAS subroutine
  **3900** (iterate AoA to the required load factor, then dynamic pressure to the
  Mach-adjusted stall line; Glauert `G/Gmn`; CLmax-vs-Mach 5th-order fit) and **4864**
  (gust load factor, FAR 23.341). Balancing
  `LT = [M(W+F) + LZ·(Xcg−Xw) − DX·(Zcg−Zw)]/(XT−Xcg)` with approximate tail CP
  (XTC≈5% / XTF≈25% tail MAC). Reads VA/VC/VD/VF, MC/MD and the limit load factors
  from STRSPEED (`design_speeds` + `_maneuver_load_factors`, the single owner).
  Registered `"flight_envelope"`; pure entry `build_envelope(project) → EnvelopeResult`.
- New Streamlit page `app/pages/07_Flight_Envelope.py` (V-n diagram + balanced-
  condition table + editable aero coeffs / CG cases). Example fixtures gain a
  `flight_loads` slice.

**Test / Acceptance.** `tests/test_flight_envelope.py` oracle-locks the Appendix A
"V-n Data" cruise matrix (p179-180) for CG1/CG2: corner speeds, load factors, α, G,
and the balancing tail load LT (e.g. STALL 1G LT 132, MAN A LT 493 / LZW 12419,
GUST +C NZ +3.96, AC ROLL LT 412, CG2 MAN A LZW 12970 / LT −59). The AoA balance
converges NZ to ±0.005 (FLTLOADS.BAS line 4130), so LT and corner speeds/factors
use tight tolerances while low-load-factor quantities use the ~0.5% convergence
floor. Concept mode checked by physics closure (the balance attains the user load
factor with no GA cap; LZ+LT = NZ·W). Full suite green (106 tests), ruff clean.

**Key decisions.**
1. **Aero coefficients are inputs** — the airplane-less-tail CL/CD/CM polynomials
   come from the Ch 7 aero-coefficients program and are entered via `AeroCoeffSet`
   (AIRLOADS/C1 does not yet emit them), faithful to the BAS prompts.
2. **Explicit CG cases, no `Project.mass`** — the balance uses the four weight-CG
   envelope cases entered directly (matching the BAS), so the original data-flow's
   `Project.mass`/WTONECG read is unnecessary for C2; seeding the CG cases from
   WTENV is a later refinement. The planned WTONECG `MassProperties` refactor was
   dropped from C2 as unneeded.
3. **Cruise scope** — the cruise maneuver+gust corner set (20 conditions); the
   flapped LANDING/ENROUTE envelopes share the balance engine and drop in later.
4. **Local atmosphere constant** — FLTLOADS' own speed-of-sound constant (518.688
   vs the shared `standard_atmosphere`'s 518.4) is replicated locally for oracle
   fidelity near the Mach cap; documented in the module.

## Phase C — Step C3: WINGINER + NETLOADS (wing net span loads) (complete)

**Objective.** The headline structural deliverable: net spanwise wing **shear,
bending moment and torsion** (air load + inertia) along the 25% chord at the
critical conditions.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/models.py` — new **`Project.wing_mass`** input slice (`WingMassInput`:
  panel weight, tip/root area-density ratio, inboard rib, wing-reference-plane
  waterline + dihedral, `ConcentratedWeight` list, `WingLoadCase` list) and the
  **`Project.loads`** result slice (`LoadsResult` = `wing_air`/`wing_inertia`/
  `wing_net`, each `WingLoadResult` of `WingStationLoad`). `AeroSurfaceInput`
  gains the section `profile_drag` (CDO) and `section_cm` (CM) tables.
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 4→5 (additive); `io.py` round-trip extended.
- `farloads/modules/airloads.py` — `air_load_distribution()` (AIRLOADS load option,
  subr 4500/4600-5060): scales the C1 Schrenk section lift to the operating CL,
  builds per-strip lift/drag/moment at `Q=V²/295`, rotates by `α=CL/M−Awo`, and
  integrates tip→root to Sz/Mxx/Myy and Sx/Mzz; drag = induced `cl·ai/57.3` +
  profile CDO.
- `farloads/modules/wing_inertia.py` (`register("wing_inertia")`) — tapered
  panel-mass distribution (root density iterated to panel weight), 1g-vertical /
  1g-drag / unit-roll unit cases combined per `(Nz, Nx, UNB)`; concentrated
  weights as spanwise steps.
- `farloads/modules/net_loads.py` (`register("net_loads")`) — net = air + inertia
  per station; per-station CSV (`wing_load_rows`). The C3-before-SELECT bridge:
  `Nz=−NZ`, `Nx=−DX/W`, CL/V read from the FLTLOADS `envelope.vn` point.
- New Streamlit page `app/pages/08_Net_Wing_Loads.py` (air/inertia/net shear, BM,
  torsion plots + station table + CSV). Example fixtures gain a `wing_mass` slice
  (and the GA wing aero gains `tau=0.05`, profile drag and section CM).

**Test / Acceptance.** `tests/test_wing_inertia.py` + `tests/test_net_loads.py`
oracle-lock the Appendix A worked example to ±0.1%: the air-load Case 22 PHAA
table (p206 — root Sz +6470, Mxx +516955, Myy −79003, Mzz −91283), the WINGINER
density (2.213/2.102 lb/ft²) and unit/combined inertia tables (p217-221), and the
Net Loads Case 22 table (p222 — root Sz +5837, Mxx +455555, Myy −60940). Concept
mode checked by the net = air + inertia identity and a trapezoidal-Schrenk root-BM
closure. Full suite green (123 tests), ruff clean.

**Key decisions.**
1. **Air-load shear/BM/torsion lives in AIRLOADS** (its "load distribution" option),
   not NETLOADS — faithful to the original; NETLOADS is the algebraic sum.
2. **TAU = 0.05 override** on the GA wing aero reproduces the manual's printed wing
   lift-curve slope exactly (C1's computed 0.0397 differs), making the full
   distribution oracle-exact; C1's oracle is independent of TAU.
3. **Full fidelity** — all of Fx/Fz/Sx/Sz/Mxx/Myy/Mzz (added the section profile-drag
   and pitching-moment inputs the drag/torsion components need), per the locked C3
   scope decision.
4. **Explicit load cases / no `Project.mass`** — the critical conditions come from
   the V-n matrix (C2) as `WingLoadCase`s (SELECT, C6, will pick them automatically);
   `Nz`/`Nx` default from the V-n point. Concentrated wing masses are supported.

---

## Phase C — Step C4: sbeam export bridge (complete)

**Objective.** Turn the NETLOADS net wing load into an sbeam-consumable
structural load set, proving the sbeam integration on the wing vertical slice.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/export/` — new output-renderer subpackage (pure strings + thin
  `write_*` wrappers; **not** a registered calc module).
  - `coordinates.py` — FAR23LOADS station-X / butt-Y / waterline-Z inches → sbeam
    global CID 0, identity map (single edit-point for any future sign/axis/unit
    change).
  - `sbeam_bridge.py` — consumes `Project.loads.wing_net` (accepts a `Project`, a
    list of `WingLoadResult`, or one result) and emits: (1) `span_load_csv` (one
    row per station per case: applied nodal `Fx/Fz/My` + cumulative
    `Sx/Sz/Mxx/Myy/Mzz`); (2) `force_moment_cards` — comma free-field unit-scale
    `FORCE, SID, GID, 0, 1.0, Fx, Fy, Fz` / `MOMENT …` (`%.6E`, ~zero components
    skipped), one SID per case, mirroring `sbeam/results/load_export.py`; (3)
    `stick_model_bdf` — a minimal SOL 101 CBAR cantilever (root clamp node + GRID
    per station + CBAR chain + PBAR/MAT1 placeholder + SPC1 + one subcase/load set
    per case).
- The applied nodal load at each station is the **increment of the cumulative**
  NETLOADS column (`dFz[i]=sz[i]−sz[i+1]`), so the FORCE set sums to the root
  shear and the MOMENT(My) set to the root torsion exactly, and (under the
  WINGINER quadrature `y[i]−y[0]=i·dy`) the FORCE moments reproduce the root
  bending exactly.
- `cli.py` — `--export-sbeam <prefix> <project.json> [--stick-model]` writes
  `<prefix>.span_loads.csv`, `<prefix>.loads.bdf` (and `<prefix>.stick.bdf`).

**Test / Acceptance.** `tests/test_sbeam_bridge.py` (10 tests) validates by
closure (no printed oracle in concept mode): re-summed FORCE/MOMENT = NETLOADS
root totals (exact); a **self-contained** free-field reader (no sbeam import)
round-trips the cards; stick-deck structure (one root clamp, connected CBAR
chain, one load set per case) and station-grid geometry checked; runs on both the
GA and concept examples. Manually verified that the real sbeam
(`/Users/seanomeara/Documents/99-Tests/sbeam`) parses the deck and **solves all
SOL 101 subcases** (`run_sol101`) with the load sets summing to the NETLOADS root
shear. Full suite green (133 tests), ruff clean.

**Key decisions.**
1. **Export bridge, not a calc module** — `farloads/export/` is a renderer
   alongside `io.py`; physics stays in `modules/net_loads.py`.
2. **Increment-of-cumulative nodal loads** — gives exact force/torsion/bending
   closure even with concentrated wing masses, since the cumulative columns
   telescope.
3. **Card style copied from sbeam** — comma free-field, unit scale + `%.6E`
   components, one SID per case, matching `sbeam/results/load_export.py`.
4. **Self-contained test parser** (no sbeam dependency in CI); the
   parses-and-solves-in-sbeam check is a documented manual step.
5. **Stick model behind a flag** — both deliverables (load-cards-only for splicing
   into a user's model, and the auto stick model) per the C4 working assumption;
   nominal placeholder PBAR/MAT1 (reactions are stiffness-independent for the
   determinate cantilever).

---

## Phase C — Step C5: Configuration & Layout page + fleet assessment (complete)

**Objective.** Satisfy "assess the configuration against similar airplanes": a
modern Configuration & Layout page that owns the high-level parametric geometry,
derives the wing/stability/gear assessment, seeds the geometry downstream, and
places the design against an extended reference fleet. No original `.BAS`; **no
manual regression oracle** (Appendix A/B geometry used only as a sanity fixture).

**Deliverables.**
- `models.py` — new `Project.configuration` slice (`LayoutInput`: fuselage L/W/H +
  datum; parametric wing area/AR/taper/dihedral/LE-sweep/LE-root/root-waterline;
  H/V tail areas + arms; gear nose/main stations, track, height). `SCHEMA_VERSION`
  bumped 5 → 6 (additive); `io.py` round-trip extended (`configuration_*_dict`).
- `modules/configuration.py` (pure, registered `"configuration"`) — trapezoidal
  wing planform → WINGGEOM LE/TE polylines; MAC/XLEMAC/Y_MAC/AR/span obtained by
  running the generated polylines through the WINGGEOM strip integrator (WINGGEOM
  stays the owner); tail-volume neutral point + static margin; tip-back / overturn
  angles; prop ground clearance.
- `app/pages/00_Configuration_Layout.py` — fuselage/wing/tail/gear input groups,
  Plotly three-view (top/side/front) with CG (25% MAC) and neutral-point markers,
  assessment panel, a "Seed wing geometry (WINGGEOM)" button, and a fleet
  comparison (W/S-vs-W/P and MTOW-vs-OEW).
- `app/data/reference_aircraft.csv` — extended with a heavier/concept tier (twin
  pistons, commuters, a bizjet, light transports); jets carry `max_hp = 0` and are
  excluded from the W/P plot.

**Test / Acceptance.** `tests/test_configuration.py` — analytic-vs-WINGGEOM-strip
MAC/Y_MAC/XLEMAC consistency ±0.1%; area/AR round-trip; Appendix A trapezoid
plausibility (MAC 69.246 / MAC butt line 87.854 within ±10%, the real wing having
an inboard strake); stability + gear quantities present when data given.
`tests/test_io.py` configuration round-trip; `tests/test_reference_aircraft.py`
extended for the new tier. Full suite green; `ruff` clean.

**Key decisions.**
1. **WINGGEOM stays the MAC owner** — configuration generates polylines and reads
   MAC/XLEMAC back from `wing_geometry.surface_properties` rather than integrating
   independently (per the "don't recompute another module's quantity" rule).
2. **First-order estimates, flagged** — tail-volume NP (`h_acw=0.25`, `a_t/a_w=1`,
   `1−dε/dα=0.6`), CG at 25% MAC when no mass slice is present; concept-mode results
   labelled unverified extrapolation. No oracle (documented).
3. **Seeding scoped to WINGGEOM** — the wing surface seed is enough for WTENV /
   STRSPEED (they read `XLEMAC`/`MAC`/area from `Project.geometry`); WTONECG station
   seeding and engine write-back deferred (recorded in the backlog).

---

## Phase C — Step C7: TAILDIST + AIRLOAD4 (complete)

**Objective.** The chordwise horizontal/vertical-tail load distribution for
SELECT's critical tail conditions (TAILDIST, Reference 1 Ch 10), and the
sweepback / high-Mach spanwise-airload branch for concept jets (AIRLOAD4,
Ch 12). The FAR23 path is oracle-locked against the Appendix A chordwise tables;
concept mode reduces to it on GA inputs.

**Deliverables.**
- `modules/taildist.py` (registers `"taildist"`) — `chordwise_pressures()` builds
  the five-station net pressure profile (additive angle-of-attack distribution at
  25% chord + camber distribution at 50% chord, TAILDIST.BAS subroutine 3000) for
  each critical h-tail / v-tail condition; `build_tail_chordwise()` reads
  `Project.envelope.critical` (SELECT) + the chordwise geometry and persists
  `Project.loads.tail_chordwise`.
- `modules/select.py` — every h-tail / v-tail `CriticalCondition` now carries the
  rational `lt25`/`lt50` split (balancing / unchecked / checked / gust /
  unsymmetrical / rudder / yaw / side-gust), the uniform TAILDIST input.
- `modules/airloads.py` — the AIRLOAD4 swept branch (`_apply_sweep`,
  `use_airload4`): the Pope & Haney sweep redistribution of the additive Schrenk
  span load, auto-selected when 25%-chord sweep > 15° or design Mach > 0.4, exactly
  identity at zero sweep / low Mach.
- `models.py` — `TailLoadsInput.htail_semispan_in`, `VTailLoadsInput.vtail_span_in`,
  `AeroSurfaceInput.sweep_deg`/`design_mach`, the `TailChordResult`/`TailChordStation`
  result types on `LoadsResult.tail_chordwise`, `CriticalCondition.lt25`/`lt50`;
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 11 → 12 (additive, older files load unchanged).
- `io.py` — `tail_chordwise` + `CriticalCondition.lt25`/`lt50` round-trip;
  `export/sbeam_bridge.py` — `tail_chordwise_csv` / `tail_force_moment_cards`
  (FORCE set scaled to the total tail load); `cli.py` — `--export-target tail`.
- `app/pages/11_Tail_Distribution.py` — the chordwise tail-distribution page.
- `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` — the Appendix A tail slices + chordwise spans.

**Test / Acceptance.** `tests/test_taildist.py`: the Appendix A "Chordwise
Distribution of Tail Loads" oracle — all **13 horizontal** (p237) + **4 vertical**
(p245) conditions' `PSI(X1..X5)` within ±0.1%; the SELECT→TAILDIST pipeline (9
flaps-retracted h-tail + 4 v-tail); the AIRLOAD4 reduction invariant + swept
closure; the schema-12 round-trip (older files still load). 174 tests pass.

**Key decisions.**
- **Full-area unified form.** TAILDIST.BAS halves the both-sides `LT25/LT50` over
  the half (LH) tail area; the suite stores full both-sides areas, so the two
  factors of two fold into the unified `WATT=LT25/S`, `WCAM=LT50/(S−Saft)` —
  verified to reproduce the oracle exactly (PSI(X1)=4·907.62/5320=0.682).
- **Deferred (recorded in the backlog):** the *printed* Appendix B swept spanwise
  oracle (needs a legible swept fixture; the reduction invariant + closure stand
  in), and the 4 flaps-extended chordwise rows (need the C6-deferred flapped V-n
  landing aero; `chordwise_pressures` covers all 13 rows directly).

## Phase C — Step C8: control-surface simplified distributions (AILERON / FLAPLOAD / TABLOADS) (complete)

**Objective.** The explicit concept-tool requirement that control surfaces use
**standard simplified distributions** — port AILERON (Ch 16), FLAPLOAD (Ch 17) and
TABLOADS (Ch 18) as FAR-style simplified pressure distributions with hinge
loads + distributed loads + CSV + sbeam bridge. The FAR23 path is oracle-locked
against the Appendix A control-surface tables; concept mode reduces to it on GA
inputs.

**Deliverables.**
- `modules/aileron.py` (registers `"aileron"`) — `aileron_loads()` computes the
  deflected up/down rolling loads (`LAIL=0.04·DEFL·SA·V²/295`, the VA/VC/VD
  deflection schedule, FAR 23.455 / CAM 3.222) and the constant-LE→taper-to-TE
  pressure; `build_aileron()` returns the two `ControlSurfaceLoadResult`s.
- `modules/flap.py` (registers `"flap"`) — `flap_loads()` over the four-condition
  flaps-extended envelope (Abbott & von Doenhoff Fig 98), the momentum-theory
  slipstream (FAR 23.457(b), sub 500) and the head-on 25 fps gust (FAR
  23.345(c)(1)); reads stall speeds/VF/weight from STRSPEED, wing area from
  geometry and MAXHP/prop diameter from the engine.
- `modules/tab.py` (registers `"tab"`) — `tab_load()` per `TabSpec` at full
  deflection at VC (FAR 23.409 / CAM 3.224, trapezoid LE = 2× TE).
- `models.py` — `AileronLoadsInput`, `FlapLoadsInput`, `TabLoadsInput`/`TabSpec`
  input slices; `ControlSurfaceLoadResult`/`ControlSurfaceStation` on
  `LoadsResult.control_surface`; `Project.aileron_loads`/`flap_loads`/`tab_loads`;
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 12 → 13 (additive, older files load unchanged). `constants.py` —
  `KT_TO_FPS_SUITE`, `DYNAMIC_PRESSURE_DIVISOR`.
- `modules/structural_speeds.py` — `design_speed_values()` exposes the scalar
  VA/VC/VD/VF + load factors the control-surface modules read (extracted from
  `design_speeds`).
- `io.py` — round-trip for the three new slices + `control_surface`;
  `export/sbeam_bridge.py` — `control_surface_csv` / `control_surface_force_moment_cards`
  (FORCE set scaled to the critical surface load, closure-checked).
- `app/pages/12_Aileron_Loads.py`, `13_Flap_Loads.py`, `14_Tab_Loads.py`.
- `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` — the Appendix A aileron/flap/tab slices.

**Test / Acceptance.** `tests/test_aileron.py`, `test_flap.py`, `test_tab.py` vs
the Appendix A reports (p200/p201/p202): aileron down 271.44 / up −180.96 lb,
psi +0.484 / −0.323; flap CLf 1.7046/1.7046/1.5593/1.5476, critical 629 lb, LE
0.545 psi, slipstream ×1.407 (BL 22.828…113.172), gust ×1.301, combined 819 lb;
tab E 0.17735, LTAB 84.62 lb, LE 0.4992 / TE 0.2496 — all within ±0.1%. Plus io
round-trip (older files load) and the sbeam control-surface FORCE-closure test.
187 tests pass.

**Key decisions.**
- **Separate per-surface input slices** (not folded into `Project.geometry`),
  mirroring `TailLoadsInput`/`VTailLoadsInput` — geometry has no hinge split.
- **Aileron oracle uses the manual's rounded VA=121**; the integrated pipeline's
  computed VA≈121.3 shifts the load ~0.3% (tested at 0.4%) — an artifact of the
  original separate-programs workflow, not an error.
- **Suite knots→ft/s factor** (`1.15·88/60`) kept verbatim for the FLAPLOAD
  slipstream so the BL band reproduces the oracle (22.828…113.172) exactly.
- **Full FLAPLOAD scope** — slipstream and head-on-gust amplifications implemented
  now (not deferred), matching the full Appendix A flap table.

## Phase C — Step C10: landing / ground loads (LGFACTOR + LANDLOAD) (complete)

**Objective.** The FAR Part 23 Subpart C ground-load conditions: the landing load
factor (LGFACTOR, FAR 23.473) and the tricycle-gear reaction loads for the level,
tail-down, one-wheel, braked-roll, side and supplementary-nose-wheel conditions
(LANDLOAD, FAR 23.473–23.499), Reference 1 Ch 20.

**Deliverables.**
- `modules/landing.py` (registers `"landing"`) — `landing_load_factor()` (LGFACTOR
  drop-test work-energy: descent `V = 4.4·(W/S)^0.25` clamped 7–10 fps, tyre/strut
  energy efficiencies, `N` and `NLG = N − L`); `landing_reactions()` (LANDLOAD: the
  drag factor `K`, ground angles, `BETA`, the `AP/BP/DP/CP` lever arms, then the 24
  main-wheel + 33 nose-wheel ground-line and airplane-datum reactions and the
  unbalanced PITCHP/ROLLP/YAWP moments); `build_landing()` resolves inputs (wing
  area from `geometry`, per-CG weight/CG from `mass` or `landing.cg_cases`) and
  persists `N → Project.landing.n`; `run()` emits one summary `ConditionResult` per
  FAR ground-load family (the critical wheel reaction).
- `models.py` — `LandingInput` + `LandingGearInput` (the dedicated `Project.landing`
  slice carrying the gear strut geometry, which has no home in the aerodynamic
  `Project.geometry`); `GearReactionCase` result record; `Project.landing`;
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 14 → 15 (additive, older files load unchanged).
- `io.py` round-trip for the nested slice (gear tuples + CG cases);
  `farloads/__init__.py` exports `LandingInput`/`LandingGearInput`/`GearReactionCase`;
  `modules/__init__.py` self-registration import.
- `app/pages/15_Landing_Loads.py` — LGFACTOR inputs + sink-rate/factor metrics, the
  gear geometry editor, the full ground-line reaction table and CSV download.
- `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` — the Appendix A GA-6 landing slice (p230 gear
  geometry, p236 LGFACTOR inputs); the file stays at `schema_version 12` to keep the
  "old file loads under v15 code" regression coverage.

**Test / Acceptance.** `tests/test_landing.py` (9 tests). **LGFACTOR fully
oracle-locked** against Appendix A p236 (V 9.0048 / N 3.0951 / NLG 2.4281; N within
+0.07% — the Decision-3 `G=32.174` vs `32.2` drift) plus the velocity-clamp and
spring-vs-oleo branches. **LANDLOAD's gear-geometry intermediates oracle-locked**
against p230 (K 0.324, GAMMA 17.978, ground angles, BETA, the AP/BP/DP/CP table).
The printed wheel-load table (p231–233) is **OCR-garbled** in the bundled PDF, so
the 24-main/33-nose matrix is **formula-closure + legible-cell spot-checked** (case
1 VMP 3144 / VNP 1787 / nose resultant 1879; level case 4 VMP 4038 / RMP 4245; side
cases VMP 2261, SMP −1700/1122). 207 tests pass; coverage ~89%.

**Key decisions.**
- **Dedicated `Project.landing` slice** rather than overloading `geometry`
  (aerodynamic surfaces) or `configuration` (which lacks the three strut-deflection
  states, rolling radii and tail-down angle LANDLOAD needs).
- **Gear load factor is a rounded design input** (2.5 on p230), kept distinct from
  LGFACTOR's computed 2.428 (`gear_load_factor` override; 0 → use `N − L`) — the
  oracle's `NAP = NLG + L = 3.167` confirms 2.5, not 2.428.
- **OCR-garbled wheel-load table → closure + legible-cell validation** (the ONENGOUT
  C9 precedent), recorded as a deferred item: add the printed ±0.1% wheel-load oracle
  if a legible Appendix A/B or `LANDLOAD.OUT` surfaces. The light-landing CG weight
  (2803 lb) was back-solved from the legible side-load cell (½·1.33·W = 1864).
- **Terminal module** (no downstream consumer), so reactions render via `ModuleResult`
  + a `build_landing()` table rather than a persisted result slice, mirroring ENGLOADS.

## Phase C — Step C9: ONENGOUT (one-engine-out vertical-tail loads) (complete)

**Objective.** Asymmetric vertical-tail loads from a critical-engine failure
(FAR 23.367, Reference 1 Ch 11) — the first module to exercise the first-class
multi-engine `Project`. Unlike SELECT's static v-tail conditions, ONENGOUT is a
**time-marching yaw simulation**: the failed engine's thrust/windmill-drag asymmetry
yaws the airplane about its vertical axis (`IZZ`) until the pilot — at peak yaw rate
but ≥2 s after failure (23.367(b)) — applies full rudder and recovers; the headline
output is the maximum vertical-tail load.

**Deliverables.**
- `modules/one_engine_out.py` (registers `"one_engine_out"`) — `simulate()` Euler-marches
  the yaw transient (thrust `MAXHP·550·.85/VTFPS`, Glauert windmill drag, tail loads
  `LT25`/`LT50` at 25%/50% MAC, moment about the CG, integrate `THETA`/`THETADOT` to
  recovery); `run()` emits one `ConditionResult` per speed (VC ultimate / VD limit / VS)
  with engine thrust, windmill drag, max yaw rate, **max tail load**, 25%/50% MAC loads
  at peak and time to recovery; `time_history()` returns the full table on demand. Below
  VMC the run is bounded (60 s) and flagged non-recovered.
- `modules/_vtail.py` — shared v-tail aero helpers (`vtail_lift_slope` AVT,
  `rudder_effectiveness` EFFECTV, `large_deflection_factor` EF); `select.py`'s private
  `_avt`/`_effectv`/`_ef` refactored to delegate (pure refactor, SELECT oracle unchanged).
- `models.py` — `OneEngineOutInput` (failure-transient timing + failed-engine index);
  `VTailLoadsInput.xv50` (FS of 50% v-tail MAC); `Project.one_engine_out`;
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 13 → 14 (additive, older files load unchanged).
- `io.py` round-trip for the new slice + `xv50`; `farloads/__init__.py` exports
  `OneEngineOutInput`; `modules/__init__.py` self-registration import.
- `app/pages/20_One_Engine_Out.py` — per-speed summary table + an on-demand time-history
  re-run (THETA/THETADOT and LT25/LT50/LT charts + CSV).

**Test / Acceptance.** The printed Appendix B (10-place twin turboprop) oracle is
**unavailable** — Appendix B is absent from the bundled `reference/FAR23 loads (1).pdf`
(only the Appendix A GA single is present, physical pp. 128–247; Appendix C source from
248) and the FAA User's Guide Ch 22 gives partial/illegible inputs and **no output
numbers**. C9 is therefore locked at the **sub-formula level** (`tests/test_one_engine_out.py`:
engine thrust, windmill drag, AVT, EFFECTV exact to `ONENGOUT.BAS`) plus
**integration/physics closure** (recovery, yaw-rate peak, `DT`-halving convergence,
below-VMC non-recovery) and **refactor-parity** with SELECT's v-tail helpers. 11 new
tests; 198 pass; SELECT oracle unchanged.

**Key decisions.**
- **No printed oracle → closure + sub-formula validation** (user-confirmed), recorded as
  a deviation from the usual ±0.1% Appendix oracle because the reference data is missing,
  not optional. The printed twin oracle + an `examples/twin_turboprop.project.json`
  fixture (also unblocks the C7 swept oracle) are deferred items.
- **Reuse SELECT's validated EF chart** (`_vtail.large_deflection_factor`) rather than the
  garbled `ONENGOUT.BAS` subr-10000 OCR; the same Dommasch fig 12:3 fits both. Wiring this
  recovered curve into SELECT's static v-tail loads (replacing `rudder_large_deflection_factor=1.0`)
  is left as a deferred mini-step.
- **Output = per-speed summary, time history on demand** (user direction): the headline
  max tail load is the primary result; the full transient is recomputed for a chosen case
  in the UI and not persisted in the schema.
- **Below-VMC handling**: the march is time-bounded (60 s) and the case flagged
  "NOT recovered" rather than looped to a step cap, mirroring the manual's note that
  recovery performance is an aero/flight-test responsibility.

## Phase C — Step C6: SELECT + fuselage/body distributed loads (complete)

**Objective.** Compute the critical flight load on each major component (wing,
horizontal tail, vertical tail, fuselage) from the FLTLOADS V-n matrix (SELECT,
Reference 1 Ch 9), and emit the fuselage longitudinal net distribution (Ch 15) +
sbeam body export. The FAR23 path stays oracle-locked against the Appendix A loads
report; concept mode reduces to it on GA inputs.

**Deliverables (R1–R10).**
- `models.py` — new slices: persisted `Project.mass` (`MassResult`/`MassCase`),
  `Project.fuselage_mass` (`FuselageMassInput`/`FuselageStation`), SELECT
  `EnvelopeResult.critical` (`CriticalLoadSet`/`CriticalCondition`), the fuselage
  net result `LoadsResult.body_net` (`BodyLoadResult`/`BodyStationLoad`),
  `Project.select_input` (`SelectInput`: aileron/airfoil-cm + wing weight),
  `Project.tail_loads` (`TailLoadsInput`: h-tail geometry/aero + elevator/maneuver/
  gust fields) and `Project.vtail_loads` (`VTailLoadsInput`). `SCHEMA_VERSION`
  6 → 11 (all additive); `io.py` round-trip extended for every slice.
- `modules/select.py` (registered `"select"`) — **wing** (PHAA/PLAA/PMAA/NMAA,
  accelerated + steady-roll TORS); **horizontal tail** balancing (23.421),
  unchecked/checked maneuver (23.423), gust (23.425(a)(1)/(2)) and unsymmetrical
  (23.427(a)), flaps retracted and extended, with the exact SELECT.BAS subr-10000
  large-deflection chart; **vertical tail** (23.441(a)(1)/(2)/(3), 23.443(b));
  **fuselage** critical conditions (23.301/23.331).
- `modules/flight_envelope.py` — the flaps-extended (LANDING) V-n corner set at VF
  (FLTLOADS subr 3000), n-limited to 2 (FAR 23.345), sea level.
- `modules/body_loads.py` (registered `"body_loads"`) — Ch 15 fuselage net shear/
  bending per critical condition → `Project.loads.body_net` + CSV.
- `modules/weight_onecg.py` — `build_mass` emits the persisted `Project.mass`.
- `export/sbeam_bridge.py` — `body_span_load_csv` / `body_force_moment_cards`.
- `app/pages/09_Critical_Loads.py`, `app/pages/10_Fuselage_Loads.py`.

**Test / Acceptance.** Oracle-locked against Appendix A (±0.1%, plus FLTLOADS'
~0.5% V-n noise): wing PHAA STALL +N (CL +1.519/V 117.40), PLAA/PMAA/NMAA/ACRL/
TORS; h-tail balancing +519.85/−613.92 (Ch 9 case-202 hand-calc LT 519.845),
unchecked −1397.8/+1227.2, checked −671.5/+787.8, gust +908.6/−1292.8,
unsymmetrical −1111.8; v-tail rudder +591 / sideslip −92 / yaw-15 −526 / side gust
+604; fuselage 13347.6 / 12569.6 / −6390.3 / Nz 5.81. Modern/closure-validated:
the fuselage net distribution (equilibrium `ΣFz=0`, shear→0 aft) and the
flaps-extended tail loads (the flapped points achieve their target NZ; the rational
balancing tail load zeroes the flapped pitching moment). Full suite green; `ruff`
clean.

**Key decisions / known limits.**
1. **Modernized-math tolerances** — selected CL/V/LT inherit FLTLOADS' ±0.005-NZ
   convergence noise (~0.5%); the renumbered envelope assigns different integer case
   indices than the manual, so tests assert the selected *condition* + values, not
   the case number.
2. **Illegible effectiveness charts modelled exactly where possible** — the
   elevator/rudder large-deflection factor `EF(δ, Se/St)` is reconstructed from
   SELECT.BAS subr 10000; the v-tail rudder-deflection loads carry an `EFV≈1.0`
   factor (a `VTailLoadsInput` input, default 1.0) since its chart is illegible in
   the scan (the AoA/gust loads are exact).
3. **Flaps-extended oracle deferred** — the real landing-config aero polynomials
   (and CG5–7 loadings) are not in the repo fixtures, so R3/R4 are closure-validated
   rather than matched to Appendix A cases 81/106/88/108. Recorded as a follow-up.
4. **`Project.mass` persisted but not yet consumed by SELECT** — the checked-
   maneuver `Iyy` and v-tail `IZZ` use the documented Ch 9 approximations (which
   match the oracle); per-CG precise inertia from `Project.mass` is a follow-up.

## Tooling & documentation standard (complete)

**Objective.** Bring the project's tooling and documentation standard in line
with the sibling `sbeam` project before the module-porting work scales up.

**Deliverables.**
- `pyproject.toml` — editable install (`pip install -e '.[dev]'`), so `farloads`
  and `cli` import from any cwd; the `sys.path` shims were removed from `app/`.
  `ruff` (select `E`/`F`/`W`, ignore `E741`) and `pytest`/coverage config.
- `cspell.json` domain wordlist.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `ruff` + `pytest` on Python 3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12.
- `docs/` reorganised by type (`10_standard` / `20_theory` / `30_future` /
  `40_history`) with `docs/00_INDEX.md`.
- `docs/10_standard/CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` and `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`;
  `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog).
- `CLAUDE.md` mandate strengthened: consult `reference/`, keep `docs/` in sync,
  and the backlog→history→changelog move-on-completion rule.

**Test / Acceptance.** `ruff check farloads/ cli.py` clean; full `pytest` suite
passing after the `sys.path` shims were removed.

**Key decisions.**
- CI lints `farloads/` and `cli.py` (the pure calc + CLI). Streamlit pages in
  `app/` are not lint-gated: their long widget-label lines and the deliberate
  late `from farloads.modules import engine` import are acceptable there.
- `requires-python = ">=3.9"` to match `sbeam` (the code uses
  `from __future__ import annotations`, so 3.9 is safe).

## Phase C — Step C11: BALLOADS (balanced-tail-load verification utility) (complete)

**Objective.** Port the off-pipeline `BALLOADS.BAS` cross-check: recompute the
horizontal-tail balancing load **rationally** (AoA load at 25% tail MAC + camber/
elevator load at 50%) per flaps-retracted V-n condition and verify FLTLOADS'
*approximate* tail centre of pressure (`XTC`~5% MAC flaps-up / `XTF`~25% flaps-down,
Ch 8). This closes the **last** of Reference 1's 22 Appendix-C programs.

**Deliverables.**
- `modules/balloads.py` (registered `"balloads"`) — `verify_balancing(project)`
  iterates every flaps-retracted V-n point (the search set of SELECT's
  `select_htail_balancing`), **reuses** `select.htail_balance` for the rational
  `LT25`/`LT50`/`DELTA`/`LT`/`CP` split and `select._elevator_load` for the elevator
  load, converts the rational CP (% tail MAC) to a fuselage station `XT` and reports
  it against FLTLOADS' assumed `XTC` (`DXT = XT − XTC`). `run(project)` emits a
  `ConditionResult` per point (FAR 23.421); raises `ValueError` (skipped by
  `run_all_modules`) when `tail_loads`/`flight_loads` are absent.
- `farloads/modules/__init__.py` — `balloads` self-registration import.
- `app/pages/16_Balanced_Tail_Verification.py` — read-only report: up/down headline
  metrics + the per-condition rational-vs-approximate CP table.
- `tests/test_balloads.py` — the Ch 9 case-202 oracle and SELECT-consistency check.
- **No schema change, no new pipeline output** (a verification report only).

**Test / Acceptance.** Oracle-locked against the Ch 9 case-202 hand-calc: the
largest up balancing load is `LT = 519.845 lb` (LT25 +907.62, LT50 −387.78, δ
−5.39°, CP 6.35% tail MAC), within the FLTLOADS ±0.5% V-n noise. The rational
up/down loads equal SELECT's `BAL UP/DN RETRACTED` conditions exactly (same
routine), and the rational CP station tracks FLTLOADS' assumed `XTC`. Full suite
green (211 tests); `ruff` clean.

**Key decisions.**
1. **Reuse over re-derivation.** Per the project convention ("must not recompute a
   quantity another module owns"), BALLOADS calls SELECT's oracle-locked
   `htail_balance`/`_elevator_load` rather than transcribing `BALLOADS.BAS`'s own
   balance equations — the verification can never silently drift from production.
   The cross-check value is preserved by comparing the rational CP station to
   FLTLOADS' *approximate* `XTC`/`XTF`.
2. **Search set = all flaps-retracted points**, not only the trimmed `BAL`
   conditions: the governing case-202 up load falls on `STALL +N` (CG1, 18000 ft),
   mirroring `select_htail_balancing`.
3. **Off-pipeline.** Runs under `run_all_modules` when its slices exist but writes
   nothing to the `Project` schema — a teaching/verification report only,
   demonstrating the elevator load is not always opposite the stabilizer load.
