# Completed Development

The authoritative record of what has shipped: completed modules/phases, key
decisions, and resolved defects. Items move here from
[`../30_future/00_backlog.md`](../30_future/00_backlog.md) the moment they close,
with a matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

Each entry uses the step format: **Objective**, **Deliverables**, **Test /
Acceptance**, **Key decisions**.

## Phase 0 — Package restructure (complete)

**Objective.** Recast the standalone `engloads` program into the shared
pure-calc package + thin-shell architecture that every subsequent module will
follow, with the engine-mount module as the proof of pattern.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/` pure-calc package: `models.py` (`Project`, `EngineInput`/`Rotor`,
  `ConditionResult`/`LoadValue`, `ModuleResult`, `SCHEMA_VERSION`),
  `modules/engine.py` (port of `ENGLOADS.BAS`), `registry.py`, `io.py`,
  `units.py`, `report.py`, `constants.py`.
- `app/` Streamlit multi-page UI (`Home.py` + `pages/19_Engine_Mount.py`).
- `cli.py` argparse front-end.
- `tests/` suite vs the manual's Appendix A/B figures.

**Test / Acceptance.** Green build — full `pytest` suite passing, engine module
checked against Appendix A (p131) and Appendix B (p251) figures within ±0.1%.

**Key decisions.**
1. **Hybrid architecture** — one shared calc package, interchangeable GUI/CLI/test
   front-ends; calc does no I/O.
2. **Single reloadable `Project`** — one JSON bundle carries every module's input
   slice; `schema_version` from day one.
3. **Modernize the math** — `math.pi` and clean equations, *not* the BASIC's
   `3.1416`. The manual's printed figures become **tolerance-based** regression
   oracles (±0.1%), not exact oracles. Constants centralised in `constants.py` so
   this stays a one-file decision.
4. **Preserved engineering conventions** — engine-mount reaction torque reported
   negative; "clockwise from the pilot's view is positive"; selected intermediate
   quantities truncated to 3 decimals (`int(x*1000)/1000`) to mirror the BASIC.

## Phase 1 — Mass properties: WTESTIMA + WTONECG (complete)

**Objective.** Port the head of the mass-properties pipeline: weight estimation
(`WTESTIMA`) and one-loading weight/CG/inertia (`WTONECG`), establishing the
shared `Project.weight` slice the downstream load modules will read. `WTENV` was
**re-scoped to Phase 2** (its structural-CG-limit math needs `XLEMAC`/`MAC` from
`WINGGEOM`); see the backlog.

**Deliverables.**
- `farloads/models.py` — `Project.weight` slice (`WeightInput`) carrying mission
  `estimation` inputs (`WeightEstimationInput`) and the itemized `items` mass list
  (`MassItem`), plus `EngineWeightType` and `MassItemKind` enums.
- `farloads/modules/weight_estimate.py` (`WTESTIMA.BAS`) and
  `farloads/modules/weight_onecg.py` (`WTONECG.BAS`), self-registered as
  `weight_estimate` / `weight_onecg`. Mass-properties constants and the
  installed-engine-weight correlation centralised in `constants.py`.
- `farloads/io.py` — `weight_from_dict`/`weight_to_dict` wired into the project
  JSON round-trip; `load_cases_csv` falls back to the generic property table for
  modules that emit no structural load cases.
- `report.module_text_report` and a generalised `cli.py` text path so non-engine
  modules render to stdout.
- `app/pages/01_Weight_Estimate.py`, `app/pages/02_Weight_CG_Inertia.py` (Imperial
  units; the CG page edits the weight data base in a `st.data_editor`).
- `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` extended with the Appendix A weight slice;
  `tests/test_weight_estimate.py` and `tests/test_weight_onecg.py`.

**Test / Acceptance.** Green build — `ruff check farloads/ cli.py` clean, full
`pytest` suite passing with the coverage floor held (≥80%). `WTESTIMA` reproduces
Appendix A p133 exactly (integer-truncated figures); `WTONECG` matches Appendix A
p136 within ±0.1% (weight and lb-in² accumulators are g-independent and exact).

**Key decisions.**
1. **One input slice, pure-calc outputs.** `Project.weight` is the shared input
   "weight database"; modules stay pure (`run → ModuleResult`). No persisted
   `Project.mass` slice yet — it is added when a consumer (FLTLOADS/LANDLOAD)
   exists.
2. **Property table, not load cases.** Mass-properties results render via
   `results_to_rows`/`module_text_report`, not the engine-specific
   `load_cases_to_rows`.
3. **Force vs mass units.** A weight is pounds-*mass* and must convert to kg, but
   a load in `lb` is pounds-*force* and converts to N — the same `"lb"` label.
   `LoadValue` gained an optional `quantity` hint; a weight sets `quantity="mass"`
   so `units.py` routes it to kg, while loads (blank hint) convert by unit string
   to N. Inertia (slug-ft²/lb-in²) → kg·m². The mass-properties pages expose an SI
   output toggle on this basis; inputs stay Imperial.
4. **Preserved BASIC quirks** — `INT(...)` truncation on `WTESTIMA` outputs, and
   the single-engine "misc other system wt = 0" (the program prints an unset
   variable there).

## Phase 2 — Geometry: WINGGEOM + first-class multi-engine (complete)

**Objective.** Port aerodynamic-surface geometry (`WINGGEOM`) — the wing's
`MAC`/`XLEMAC` seed `WTENV` and `STRSPEED` — and, alongside it, promote the engine
slice to first-class multi-engine support (resolving PROJECT_GUIDE open decision
#2) so geometry/weight/speeds can reference the engine layout now and `ONENGOUT`
can exercise it fully later.

**Deliverables.**
- **Multi-engine schema** — `EngineLayout` enum (`SINGLE_NOSE`/`TWIN_WING`/
  `QUAD_WING`, symmetric); `Project.engines: List[EngineInput]` + `engine_layout`
  with `__post_init__` count validation and a read-only `Project.engine` compat
  property. `io.py` reads the new `engines`/`engine_layout` JSON or the legacy
  single `engine` key; `modules/engine.py` `run()` loops over every engine
  (single-engine output byte-identical, multi-engine prefixed by designation).
- `farloads/models.py` — `Project.geometry` slice (`GeometryInput` →
  `SurfaceInput` per surface: LE/TE point polylines, `symmetric`, `elements`).
- `farloads/modules/wing_geometry.py` (`WINGGEOM.BAS`), self-registered as
  `wing_geometry`: strip-sum area/MAC/YBAR/XLEMAC/AR/span per surface, plus
  wing-mounted engine spanwise stations driven by `engine_layout`.
- `farloads/io.py` — `geometry_from_dict`/`geometry_to_dict`; `units.py` gained
  area (`in²`→m²) and airspeed (`knot`→m/s) SI output conversions.
- `app/pages/03_Wing_Geometry.py` (per-surface point editors, SI output toggle);
  `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` extended with wing + aileron surfaces and the
  multi-engine layout form; `tests/test_wing_geometry.py` and new multi-engine
  assertions in `tests/test_engine.py`.

**Test / Acceptance.** Green build — `ruff check farloads/ cli.py` clean, full
`pytest` suite passing, coverage floor held (≥80%). The **wing** reproduces
Appendix A p141 within ±0.1% (AREA/SIDE 13257, MAC 69.246, YLE(MAC) 87.854,
XLE(MAC) 63.641, AR 6.095) at the manual's 20-element strip count; the aileron
exercises the unsymmetric path (checked loosely, since Appendix A does not
tabulate its element count).

**Key decisions.**
1. **Strip count is an input, oracle is H-specific.** The manual's printed figures
   *are* the `H`-element midpoint strip sum, so `elements` must match the manual's
   value (20 for the wing) to reproduce them — kept as a per-surface field.
2. **Multi-engine first-class now.** Engine list + layout modelled this phase;
   the engine module loops over engines, but one-engine-out *loads* remain at
   `ONENGOUT`. Backward-compatible: legacy single-`engine` JSON still loads.
3. **Wing is the authoritative oracle.** `XLEMAC`/`MAC` (the figures the whole
   pipeline cites) are matched tightly; secondary surfaces use the same calc.

## Tooling & documentation standard (complete)

**Objective.** Bring the project's tooling and documentation standard in line
with the sibling `sbeam` project before the module-porting work scales up.

**Deliverables.**
- `pyproject.toml` — editable install (`pip install -e '.[dev]'`), so `farloads`
  and `cli` import from any cwd; the `sys.path` shims were removed from `app/`.
  `ruff` (select `E`/`F`/`W`, ignore `E741`) and `pytest`/coverage config.
- `cspell.json` domain wordlist.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `ruff` + `pytest` on Python 3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12.
- `docs/` reorganised by type (`10_standard` / `20_theory` / `30_future` /
  `40_history`) with `docs/00_INDEX.md`.
- `docs/10_standard/CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` and `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`;
  `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog).
- `CLAUDE.md` mandate strengthened: consult `reference/`, keep `docs/` in sync,
  and the backlog→history→changelog move-on-completion rule.

**Test / Acceptance.** `ruff check farloads/ cli.py` clean; full `pytest` suite
passing after the `sys.path` shims were removed.

**Key decisions.**
- CI lints `farloads/` and `cli.py` (the pure calc + CLI). Streamlit pages in
  `app/` are not lint-gated: their long widget-label lines and the deliberate
  late `from farloads.modules import engine` import are acceptable there.
- `requires-python = ">=3.9"` to match `sbeam` (the code uses
  `from __future__ import annotations`, so 3.9 is safe).
